### Blog based on [medium-editor by yabwe](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)

I really liked Medium's writing interface, I could store stuff, keep it in progress, update it later.
So that's what I'm doing here but it's my own content/blog that I can grow over time.

I'm not doing anything crazy, just making a matching back-end and doing some minor file handling for the images eg. resizing on server side and editing the blobs/replacing with multi-size images for responsiveness.

Linked to custom node backend [here](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/vantawing-blog-backend)

### Note
This is intended to be accessed only by me/not public facing. So it will have an auth guard but that's it.
I'll figure out how to make custom projects/save against unique titles/load them up.
